In a galaxy far far away, there is a dog breed trying to survive in treacherous territories of the Bark Way galaxy. They, escaped from the clutches of humans, now with their minds clouded by possession and control over other races, which has forced many species of animals to escape from planet Earth, and find a new place where they can make their own species survive.

But we will talk about our canine heroes, who after many misadventures, managed to found The Capital, an "advanced" center that, meritocratic and contributory state where every member of society will contribute indiscriminately to the cause.

Being recently settled, their city is not yet very developed, and very often they need to antiquarian systems, but with time they have managed to develop very efficient systems to facilitate their daily work.

"Shibari" are very interested in hunting, which is their main source of finding food, but they are also very interested in valuable materials and resources, which enable them to build spacecraft, and travel between various planets, and in some cases other galaxies.
